\noindent Dear Judge Smith,

This is an example, where I cite something \footfullcite{p1tightbond} and then some more \footfullcite{p2controlling} and then refer to some emails that show a similar dynamic \footfullcite{email1}. 

The timeline of the case is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tl}, and shows that there was an initial period of cooperation, followed by a period of conflict, and then a period of cooperation again.
